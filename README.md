# AdaptiveReinforcementLearning-BasedRoboticArm
 This project proposes a real-time adaptive motion planning framework using  Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP).  A camera-based perception system will detect the robotic armâ€™s start and end  positions while continuously tracking obstacles.
